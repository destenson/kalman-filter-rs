# PRP: Comprehensive Documentation for Kalman Filter Library

## Goal
Transform the kalman_filter crate from undocumented to the most well-documented Kalman filter library in the Rust ecosystem, enabling immediate adoption and understanding by users of all expertise levels.

## Why
- **Current State**: Empty README.md (1 line), sparse rustdoc comments
- **User Impact**: Without documentation, even excellent code is unusable
- **Market Position**: Good documentation differentiates from existing crates
- **Adoption Barrier**: Engineers need to understand both the library AND Kalman filter theory

## What
Create comprehensive documentation including:
1. Professional README with theory, examples, and comparisons
2. Complete rustdoc for all public APIs with examples
3. Tutorial-style documentation for each filter variant
4. Mathematical background with LaTeX equations
5. Migration guide from other Kalman filter crates

### Success Criteria
- [ ] README.md with badges, installation, quick start, and theory
- [ ] 100% rustdoc coverage on public items
- [ ] Each filter variant has a tutorial example
- [ ] Mathematical equations properly formatted
- [ ] Comparison table with other Rust Kalman crates
- [ ] Documentation builds on docs.rs

## All Needed Context

### Documentation References
```yaml

  why: Well-documented Rust Kalman filter to reference for structure
  
- url: https://github.com/sebcrozet/nalgebra
  why: Excellent Rust library documentation patterns to follow
  
- url: https://www.kalmanfilter.net/
  why: Comprehensive Kalman filter theory reference
  
- url: https://docs.rs/about/builds
  why: docs.rs configuration requirements
  
- url: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/documentation.html
  why: Rust API documentation guidelines
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter-0.1.2\src\filter.rs
  why: Main filter implementation - needs comprehensive docs
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter-0.1.2\examples\simple_1d.rs
  why: Example of good inline documentation pattern to follow
```

### Existing Documentation Patterns in Codebase
- Module-level docs use `//!` at file start
- Struct/function docs use `///` with sections for arguments, returns, examples
- Examples directory has good inline comments explaining theory
- Some modules already have theory sections (e.g., information/mod.rs)

### README Structure to Follow
Based on successful crates like nalgebra and adskalman:
1. Title with badges (crates.io, docs.rs, CI status)
2. One-paragraph description
3. Features bullet list
4. Quick start code example
5. Installation instructions
6. Comprehensive examples section
7. Theory/background (optional but valuable)
8. Comparison with alternatives
9. Contributing guidelines
10. License

### Known Documentation Gotchas
- LaTeX math in rustdoc requires special syntax: `\\( equation \\)` or use Unicode
- docs.rs requires all features documented - use `#[cfg_attr(docsrs, doc(cfg(...)))]`
- README examples must be tested manually or marked as `no_run`
- Cargo.toml needs `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` section for features

## Implementation Blueprint

### Task List (in order)

1. **Create comprehensive README.md**
   - Add badges for crates.io, docs.rs, license, build status
   - Write elevator pitch and feature list
   - Add installation section with feature flags
   - Create quick start example (copy from simple_1d.rs)
   - Add theory section with ASCII art state diagrams
   - Create comparison table with other crates
   - Add migration guides from kalman-rs, adskalman

2. **Document core filter module (src/filter.rs)**
   - Add comprehensive module docs with theory
   - Document all public structs with examples
   - Add inline examples for predict() and update()
   - Explain matrix dimensions and conventions
   - Add "Errors" sections for fallible functions

3. **Document all filter variants**
   - Extended (src/extended.rs) - explain linearization
   - Unscented (src/unscented.rs) - sigma points theory
   - Information (src/information/mod.rs) - dual formulation
   - Ensemble (src/ensemble/mod.rs) - Monte Carlo approach
   - Particle (src/particle/mod.rs) - non-Gaussian handling
   - Cubature (src/scented.rs) - spherical-radial rule

4. **Create tutorial examples**
   - Expand each example with step-by-step comments
   - Add README.md in examples/ explaining each one
   - Create new tutorial for filter selection guide

5. **Add mathematical documentation**
   - Create MATH.md with full derivations
   - Use KaTeX notation compatible with docs.rs
   - Include covariance update forms (Joseph, symmetric)
   - Explain numerical stability considerations

6. **Configure docs.rs build**
   - Add `[package.metadata.docs.rs]` to Cargo.toml
   - Set all-features = true for complete docs
   - Add feature requirement badges to functions

### Documentation Quality Checklist
- Every public item has a doc comment
- Every module has a //! header explaining purpose
- Examples compile and run
- Mathematical notation is consistent
- Cross-references use proper rustdoc links
- Error conditions are documented
- Performance characteristics noted where relevant

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Check documentation coverage
cargo doc --all-features --no-deps
cargo doc --all-features --no-deps --open  # Manual review

# Verify examples in documentation
cargo test --doc --all-features

# Check README examples work (manually)
# Copy each code block to a temp file and run

# Ensure clean formatting
cargo fmt --all -- --check

# Verify all public items documented
cargo rustdoc --all-features -- -D missing_docs

# Build documentation as docs.rs would
RUSTDOCFLAGS="--cfg docsrs" cargo +nightly doc --all-features
```

## Error Handling Strategy
- Documentation examples should use `.expect()` with clear messages
- Show both error handling and simplified versions
- Explain when functions can fail and why

## References for Implementation
- Rust API Guidelines: https://rust-lang.github.io/api-guidelines/
- docs.rs metadata: https://docs.rs/about/metadata
- KaTeX supported functions: https://katex.org/docs/supported.html
- Other Kalman crates for comparison:
  - https://crates.io/crates/adskalman (0.17.0) - 600+ downloads/month
  - https://crates.io/crates/minikalman (0.6.0) - 100+ downloads/month
  - https://crates.io/crates/kalman-rust (0.2.3) - sparse docs

## Notes for AI Agent
- Start with README as it's the entry point
- Use existing examples as documentation source material
- Keep mathematical notation consistent throughout
- Focus on practical usage over theoretical proofs
- Include troubleshooting section for common issues
- Test documentation examples as you write them

## Quality Score: 9/10
Comprehensive research with specific patterns to follow, clear task ordering, and concrete validation gates. Deducted one point as mathematical notation in rustdoc may require iteration to get right, but all necessary context is provided for successful implementation.
