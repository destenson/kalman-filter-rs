# Kalman Filter PRPs (Project Requirements and Planning)

## Overview
This directory contains detailed implementation plans for enhancing the kalman_filter crate from a working implementation to a production-ready, well-documented, and thoroughly validated library.

## PRPs Created

### 1. [Comprehensive Documentation](01-comprehensive-documentation.md) - **Priority: HIGH**
**Goal**: Transform from undocumented to the best-documented Kalman filter library in Rust.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Professional README with theory and examples
- 100% rustdoc coverage
- Tutorial for each filter variant
- Mathematical documentation
- Migration guides from other crates

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Quality Score**: 9/10

### 2. [Performance Benchmarks](02-performance-benchmarks.md) - **Priority: MEDIUM**
**Goal**: Establish performance baselines and enable optimization.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Benchmarks for all 7 filter variants
- Dimension scaling tests (2D to 1000D)
- Sparse vs dense comparisons
- Memory profiling
- CI regression detection

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Quality Score**: 9/10

### 3. [Algorithm Validation](03-algorithm-validation.md) - **Priority: HIGH**
**Goal**: Prove mathematical correctness and numerical stability.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Mathematical property tests
- Analytical solution validation
- Reference implementation comparison
- Property-based testing with quickcheck
- Numerical stability edge cases

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Quality Score**: 10/10

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Documentation (Week 1)
Start with documentation as it's user-facing and enables adoption:
1. Execute PRP-01 (Comprehensive Documentation)
2. Generates immediate value for users
3. No code changes required

### Phase 2: Validation (Week 1-2)
Ensure correctness before optimizing:
1. Execute PRP-03 (Algorithm Validation)
2. Builds confidence in implementation
3. Catches any existing bugs

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 2)
Optimize with confidence:
1. Execute PRP-02 (Performance Benchmarks)
2. Measure current performance
3. Guide optimization efforts

## Success Metrics

### Documentation Success
- [ ] README > 500 lines with examples
- [ ] All public items documented
- [ ] Builds on docs.rs
- [ ] Examples for each filter type

### Validation Success
- [ ] 50+ validation tests
- [ ] Matches reference implementations
- [ ] Property tests with 1000+ cases
- [ ] Handles edge cases gracefully

### Benchmark Success
- [ ] All variants benchmarked
- [ ] Performance regression detection
- [ ] Published benchmark results
- [ ] Comparison with adskalman

## Quick Execution Commands

```bash
# Documentation PRP
cargo rustdoc --all-features -- -D missing_docs
cargo doc --all-features --open

# Validation PRP
cargo test --test validation --all-features
QUICKCHECK_TESTS=10000 cargo test --test quickcheck

# Benchmark PRP
cargo bench --bench kalman_benchmarks
cargo bench --bench kalman_benchmarks -- --save-baseline main
```

## Notes
- Each PRP is self-contained and can be executed independently
- All PRPs include validation gates for verification
- Quality scores indicate confidence in one-pass implementation
- Total estimated effort: 7-9 days for all three PRPs

## Next Steps
1. Review PRPs for completeness
2. Execute in recommended order
3. Validate against success criteria
4. Publish to crates.io once complete
