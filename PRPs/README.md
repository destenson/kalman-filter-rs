# Kalman Filter PRPs (Project Requirements and Planning)

## Overview
This directory contains detailed implementation plans for enhancing the kalman_filter crate from a working implementation to a production-ready, well-documented, and thoroughly validated library.

## PRPs Created

### 1. [Comprehensive Documentation](01-comprehensive-documentation.md) - **Priority: HIGH**
**Goal**: Transform from undocumented to the best-documented Kalman filter library in Rust.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Professional README with theory and examples
- 100% rustdoc coverage
- Tutorial for each filter variant
- Mathematical documentation
- Migration guides from other crates

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Quality Score**: 9/10

### 2. [Performance Benchmarks](02-performance-benchmarks.md) - **Priority: MEDIUM**
**Goal**: Establish performance baselines and enable optimization.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Benchmarks for all 7 filter variants
- Dimension scaling tests (2D to 1000D)
- Sparse vs dense comparisons
- Memory profiling
- CI regression detection

**Estimated Effort**: 2 days
**Quality Score**: 9/10

### 3. [Algorithm Validation](03-algorithm-validation.md) - **Priority: HIGH**
**Goal**: Prove mathematical correctness and numerical stability.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Mathematical property tests
- Analytical solution validation
- Reference implementation comparison
- Property-based testing with quickcheck
- Numerical stability edge cases

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Quality Score**: 10/10

## Implementation Order

### Phase 1: Documentation (Week 1)
Start with documentation as it's user-facing and enables adoption:
1. Execute PRP-01 (Comprehensive Documentation)
2. Generates immediate value for users
3. No code changes required

### Phase 2: Validation (Week 1-2)
Ensure correctness before optimizing:
1. Execute PRP-03 (Algorithm Validation)
2. Builds confidence in implementation
3. Catches any existing bugs

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 2)
Optimize with confidence:
1. Execute PRP-02 (Performance Benchmarks)
2. Measure current performance
3. Guide optimization efforts

## Success Metrics

cargo bench --bench kalman_benchmarks -- --save-baseline main
```

### 4. [State of the Art Review](04-state-of-art-review.md) - **Priority: HIGH**
**Goal**: Review all major Kalman filter implementations and establish competitive position.

**Key Deliverables**:
- Feature comparison matrix with 10+ implementations
- Performance benchmarks against top Rust crates
- Best practices extraction
- Competitive analysis report
- Feature roadmap based on gaps

**Estimated Effort**: 2-3 days
**Quality Score**: 9/10

### 5. [Cross-Validation Testing](05-cross-validation-testing.md) - **Priority: CRITICAL**
**Goal**: Validate against established implementations to ensure correctness.

**Key Deliverables**:
- FilterPy test suite adaptation
- PyKalman validation tests
- Standard dataset validation
- MATLAB/Octave comparison
- Cross-implementation equivalence proof

**Estimated Effort**: 3-4 days
**Quality Score**: 10/10

## Updated Implementation Order

### Phase 0: Competitive Analysis (Week 0)
Understand the landscape before making changes:
1. Execute PRP-04 (State of the Art Review)
2. Identifies features to add
3. Establishes performance targets

### Phase 1: Validation First (Week 1)
Ensure correctness against references:
1. Execute PRP-05 (Cross-Validation Testing)
2. Proves equivalence with established implementations
3. Discovers any algorithmic issues
4. Execute PRP-03 (Algorithm Validation)
5. Ensures mathematical correctness

### Phase 2: Documentation (Week 2)
Document with confidence in correctness:
1. Execute PRP-01 (Comprehensive Documentation)
2. Can claim "validated against FilterPy/PyKalman"
3. Include competitive advantages

### Phase 3: Performance (Week 2-3)
Optimize validated implementation:
1. Execute PRP-02 (Performance Benchmarks)
2. Compare against competitors identified in Phase 0
3. Optimize with confidence in correctness

## Notes
- Each PRP is self-contained and can be executed independently
- All PRPs include validation gates for verification
- Quality scores indicate confidence in one-pass implementation
- Total estimated effort: 12-16 days for all five PRPs
- New PRPs focus on validation and competitive positioning

## Next Steps
1. Review PRPs for completeness
2. Execute state of the art review first
3. Validate against reference implementations
4. Complete documentation and benchmarks
5. Publish to crates.io as "most validated Kalman filter library"
