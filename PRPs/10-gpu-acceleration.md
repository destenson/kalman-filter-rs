# PRP: GPU/APU Acceleration for Large-Scale Filtering

## Goal
Add optional GPU acceleration to the Kalman filter library for massive performance improvements (10-100x) on large-scale problems, particularly benefiting particle filters, ensemble filters, and high-dimensional state spaces commonly found in computer vision, weather modeling, and financial applications.

## Why
- **Scale Limitations**: CPU-bound for states >100D or particles >10,000
- **Particle Filter Bottleneck**: PF with 100k particles needs GPU parallelism
- **Ensemble Scaling**: EnKF with 1000+ members ideal for GPU
- **Market Demand**: CV/ML applications expect GPU support (see SOTA.md)
- **Competitive Necessity**: MATLAB, Julia already have GPU-accelerated filters

## What
Implement GPU-accelerated compute backends for:
1. Large matrix operations (>100x100)
2. Particle filter parallel operations
3. Ensemble member parallel updates
4. Batch processing multiple independent filters
5. High-dimensional sensor fusion

### Success Criteria
- [ ] 10x+ speedup for 1000D state space
- [ ] 50x+ speedup for 100k particle filter
- [ ] Support CUDA, ROCm, and Metal backends
- [ ] Automatic CPU fallback when GPU unavailable
- [ ] Memory transfer optimization (<10% overhead)
- [ ] Integration with existing API (no breaking changes)

## All Needed Context

### Current Computational Bottlenecks
```yaml
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter_rs\src\particle\filter.rs
  why: Particle operations embarrassingly parallel
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter_rs\src\ensemble\filter.rs
  why: Ensemble members can be updated in parallel
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter_rs\src\filter.rs:200-245
  why: Matrix operations that would benefit from GPU
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter_rs\benches\kalman_benchmarks.rs:190-270
  why: Scaling benchmarks show where GPU would help
```

### GPU Compute Options for Rust

  why: Mature, cross-platform GPU library (CUDA/OpenCL/CPU)
  
- url: https://github.com/Rust-GPU/Rust-CUDA
  why: Native CUDA support with Rust safety
  
- url: https://github.com/gfx-rs/wgpu

```

### Performance Benchmarks from Research
- ArrayFire: 2-100x speedup depending on problem size
- CUDA direct: Best performance but NVIDIA-only
- wgpu: 5-20x speedup, works everywhere including browsers
- Optimal crossover: ~100x100 matrices, ~1000 particles

### GPU Architecture Considerations
```yaml
Memory Hierarchy:
- Global memory: Large but slow (400-900 GB/s)
- Shared memory: Fast but small (48-96 KB per SM)
- Registers: Fastest but very limited

Optimization Strategies:
- Coalesced memory access patterns
- Minimize host-device transfers
- Batch operations to amortize overhead
- Use GPU-persistent state for iterative filters
```

### Platform Support Matrix
| Backend | Platforms | Performance | Complexity |
|---------|-----------|-------------|------------|
| CUDA | NVIDIA only | Excellent | Medium |
| ROCm | AMD GPUs | Very Good | Medium |
| Metal | Apple Silicon | Good | Low |
| OpenCL | Universal | Good | High |
| WebGPU | Universal | Moderate | Low |
| ArrayFire | All above | Very Good | Very Low |

### Known Gotchas
- Memory transfer overhead can negate GPU benefits for small problems
- GPU memory limitations (typical 8-24GB vs system RAM)
- Precision differences (GPU often optimized for f32)
- Warmup costs - first kernel launch is slow
- Not all operations parallelize well (sequential dependencies)

impl KalmanFilter {
    pub fn with_gpu(mut self) -> Result<Self> {
        #[cfg(feature = "gpu")]
        {
            self.gpu_context = Some(GpuContext::new()?);
            self.transfer_to_gpu()?;
        }
        Ok(self)
    }
    
    pub fn predict(&mut self) {
        #[cfg(feature = "gpu")]
        if let Some(ref mut gpu) = self.gpu_context {
            if self.state_dim > GPU_THRESHOLD {
                return gpu.predict();
            }
        }
        self.predict_cpu()
    }
}
```

### Threshold Configuration
```
// Empirically determined thresholds
const GPU_MATRIX_THRESHOLD: usize = 100;  // 100x100 matrices
const GPU_PARTICLE_THRESHOLD: usize = 1000;  // 1000 particles
const GPU_ENSEMBLE_THRESHOLD: usize = 50;  // 50 ensemble members
```

## Error Handling Strategy
- Graceful fallback to CPU if GPU unavailable
- Clear error messages for GPU initialization failures
- Handle out-of-memory errors with automatic batching
- Timeout handling for stuck kernels
- Diagnostic mode to force CPU/GPU selection

## Migration Strategy
1. GPU support is fully optional - zero impact when disabled
2. Automatic selection based on problem size
3. Manual override via `with_gpu()` method
4. Environment variables for fine control
5. Preserve exact numerical results (within f32 precision)

## Performance Monitoring
```toml
[env]
KALMAN_GPU_THRESHOLD_MATRIX = "100"
KALMAN_GPU_THRESHOLD_PARTICLE = "1000"
KALMAN_GPU_PROFILE = "1"  # Enable profiling
KALMAN_FORCE_GPU = "1"    # Force GPU even for small problems
KALMAN_FORCE_CPU = "1"    # Disable GPU
```

## Notes for AI Agent
- Start with ArrayFire for fastest implementation
- Test with small matrices first, verify correctness
- Profile to find actual crossover points
- Don't GPU-accelerate everything - overhead matters
- Batch operations whenever possible
- Keep intermediate results on GPU
- Use f32 on GPU unless f64 absolutely needed
- Consider unified memory on modern GPUs
