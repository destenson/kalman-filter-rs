# Feature Flag Propagation to Dependencies

## Summary
Ensure all feature flags (`std`, `alloc`, etc.) properly propagate to dependencies that support these features, enabling correct compilation in both std and no_std environments.

## Context
The crate currently has incomplete feature flag propagation. The `std` feature only enables `rand_distr/std` and `adskalman?/std`, but many other dependencies also have std/alloc features that should be enabled accordingly.

## Problem Statement
When building for no_std environments, dependencies might still pull in std functionality because we're not properly disabling their default features or enabling the correct feature combinations. This can lead to:
- Compilation failures in embedded/no_std environments
- Larger binary sizes than necessary
- Unexpected std dependencies in supposedly no_std builds

## Research Findings

### Dependencies with std/alloc Support

Based on documentation research:

1. **rand** (v0.8)
   - Has `std` feature (enabled by default)
   - Has `alloc` feature for no_std with allocation
   - Reference: https://rust-random.github.io/book/crate-features.html

2. **rand_distr** (v0.4)
   - Has `std` feature (enabled by default) 
   - Has `alloc` feature
   - Already configured with `default-features = false`
   - Currently handled correctly in Cargo.toml

3. **num-traits** (v0.2)
   - Has `std` feature (enabled by default)
   - Has `libm` feature for no_std float operations
   - Reference: https://github.com/rust-num/num-traits

4. **approx** (v0.5)
   - May support no_std (needs verification)
   - Documentation: https://docs.rs/approx/latest/approx/

5. **log** (v0.4)
   - Has `std` feature (optional)
   - Works in no_std by default
   - Reference: https://docs.rs/log/latest/log/

6. **nalgebra** (v0.34)
   - Has multiple features including `std`, `alloc`, `serde`
   - Can work in no_std environments
   - Reference: https://docs.rs/nalgebra/latest/nalgebra/

## Implementation Strategy

### Step 1: Update Dependencies Section
Modify dependencies to disable default features where appropriate:
- Change dependencies that have std as default feature
- Use `default-features = false` pattern
- Explicitly enable required non-std features

### Step 2: Update Feature Flags

#### std Feature
Should enable std on all supporting dependencies:
- `rand/std`
- `rand_distr/std` (already done)
- `num-traits/std`  
- `log/std`
- `nalgebra?/std` (when nalgebra feature is enabled)
- `approx/std` (if supported)
- `adskalman?/std` (already done)

#### alloc Feature
Should enable alloc on all supporting dependencies:
- `rand/alloc`
- `rand_distr/alloc` (already done)
- `nalgebra?/alloc` (when nalgebra feature is enabled)
- `num-traits/libm` (for no_std math operations)

#### serde Feature
Should also enable serde on dependencies when applicable:
- `nalgebra?/serde` (when both nalgebra and serde are enabled)
- `log/serde` (if needed)

### Step 3: Feature Composition
Ensure proper feature implications:
- `std` should imply `alloc` (std includes allocation)
- Features should compose correctly when multiple are enabled

## File Modifications

### Cargo.toml
Location: `C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter_rs\Cargo.toml`

Update structure:
1. Dependencies section: Add `default-features = false` where needed
2. Features section: Add proper feature propagation

Pattern to follow from the file:
- Line 31: `rand_distr = { version = "0.4", default-features = false }` 
- This pattern should be applied to other dependencies

## Testing Strategy

### No-std Verification
Create a test build configuration to verify no_std support:
1. Build with `--no-default-features`
2. Build with `--no-default-features --features alloc`
3. Ensure no std symbols are linked

### Feature Combination Matrix
Test critical combinations:
- Default (std)
- No features
- Only alloc
- nalgebra without std
- serde without std (if applicable)

## Validation Gates

```bash
# Build with various feature combinations
cargo build --no-default-features
cargo build --no-default-features --features alloc
cargo build --no-default-features --features "alloc nalgebra"
cargo build --all-features

# Check for std dependencies in no_std build
cargo tree --no-default-features | grep -v "kalman_filters"

# Run tests with different features
cargo test --no-default-features --features alloc
cargo test --all-features

# Verify examples still work
cargo build --examples --all-features

# Check that we haven't broken anything
cargo clippy --all-features -- -D warnings
```

## Success Criteria
1. ✅ Crate builds successfully with `--no-default-features`
2. ✅ All dependencies respect feature flags
3. ✅ No unexpected std dependencies in no_std builds
4. ✅ All existing tests pass with updated configuration
5. ✅ Feature combinations work as expected

## Common Pitfalls
- Don't forget optional dependencies (marked with `?` in feature definitions)
- Some crates use different names for similar features (e.g., `libm` vs `std`)
- Order matters in feature definitions - list implications correctly
- Test on actual no_std target (e.g., thumbv7m-none-eabi) for true verification

## Quality Score: 9/10
Clear problem definition with researched dependency features. Provides specific implementation steps and comprehensive testing strategy. Deducted one point because some dependency features (like approx) need runtime verification.
