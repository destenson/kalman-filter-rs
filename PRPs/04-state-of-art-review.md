# PRP: State of the Art Review and Competitive Analysis

## Goal
Conduct a comprehensive review of Kalman filter implementations as of August 2025, establish our competitive position, and identify features/optimizations to incorporate.

## Why
- **Market Positioning**: Need to understand where we stand in the ecosystem
- **Feature Gaps**: Identify missing features from competitor implementations
- **Best Practices**: Learn from successful implementations
- **Performance Targets**: Establish benchmarks against state-of-the-art
- **Documentation Standards**: Match or exceed industry standards

## What
Create a comprehensive competitive analysis that:
1. Surveys all major Kalman filter implementations (Rust, Python, C++, MATLAB)
2. Compares feature matrices across implementations
3. Benchmarks performance against competitors
4. Identifies unique selling points and gaps
5. Documents best practices from each implementation

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Feature comparison matrix with 10+ implementations
- [ ] Performance benchmarks against top 3 Rust crates
- [ ] Identified 5+ features to add from competitors
- [ ] Documentation comparing algorithmic approaches
- [ ] Published competitive analysis in SOTA.md

## All Needed Context

### Rust Implementations to Review
```yaml
- url: https://github.com/strawlab/adskalman-rs
  why: Most mature Rust implementation with 600+ downloads/month
  features: Rauch-Tung-Striebel smoothing, no_std support, compile-time type checking
  
- url: https://crates.io/crates/kfilter
  why: Recent (July 2024) no-std implementation with static matrices
  features: Extended Kalman Filter, nalgebra backend, embedded focus
  
- url: https://github.com/spdes/kalman-rust
  why: Python-like syntax, includes cross-language benchmarks
  features: RTS smoother, ndarray backend, readable for Python users
  
- url: https://github.com/rbagd/rust-linearkalman
  why: Time-invariant filtering with smoothing
  features: Fixed-interval smoothing, rulinalg backend
  
- url: https://crates.io/crates/kalmanrs
  why: Listed on crates.io, needs investigation
  
- file: C:\Users\deste\repos\kalman_filter-0.1.2\src\filter.rs
  why: Our implementation to compare against
```

### Python Implementations for Reference
```yaml
- url: https://github.com/rlabbe/filterpy
  why: Most comprehensive Python library with book
  features: KF, EKF, UKF, PF, g-h filter, H-infinity, smoothers
  tests: Visual validation focus, pedagogical clarity
  
- url: https://github.com/pykalman/pykalman
  why: Production-focused with numerical stability
  features: EM algorithm, square-root forms, comprehensive tests
  tests: Robot dataset validation, numerical precision checks
```

### Key Performance Findings
- FilterPy (Python) is ~22x slower than optimized Rust
- Initial Rust implementation was 3-4x slower before optimization
- Main optimizations: avoiding memory copies, contiguous array access
- nalgebra faster for small fixed matrices, ndarray for large arrays

### Features to Analyze
1. **Core Filters**: KF, EKF, UKF, PF, EnKF, CKF
2. **Smoothers**: RTS, Two-filter, Forward-backward
3. **Numerical Stability**: Joseph form, square-root, UD factorization
4. **Advanced**: Adaptive filtering, IMM, H-infinity
5. **Utilities**: Sigma points, residual analysis, consistency checks
