# PRP: Advanced Kalman Filter Variations

## Goal
Implement a suite of advanced Kalman filter variations including Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), Particle Filter (PF), Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF), and Information Filter (IF) to handle high-dimensional, non-Gaussian, and distributed estimation problems.

## Why
- **High Dimensions**: EnKF handles millions of state variables (weather prediction, reservoir modeling)
- **Non-Gaussian**: Particle filters handle arbitrary distributions without Gaussian assumptions
- **Numerical Stability**: Information filter provides better conditioning for sparse measurements
- **Improved Accuracy**: CKF provides better numerical integration than UKF for certain problems
- **Specialized Domains**: Each variation optimal for specific application domains

## What
Create a modular framework supporting multiple advanced Kalman filter variations, each optimized for different problem characteristics while sharing common infrastructure.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] EnKF handles high-dimensional systems (1000+ states)
- [ ] Particle filter supports non-Gaussian distributions
- [ ] Information filter provides numerically stable sparse updates
- [ ] Cubature filter achieves 3rd-degree accuracy
- [ ] All filters share common traits and infrastructure
- [ ] Examples demonstrate each filter's strengths
- [ ] Performance benchmarks guide filter selection

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
- CRITICAL: EnKF requires ensemble size << state dimension for efficiency
- CRITICAL: Particle filter suffers from degeneracy - needs resampling
- CRITICAL: Information filter uses inverse covariance (information matrix)
- CRITICAL: CKF cubature points scale with dimension squared
- CRITICAL: Distributed filters need consensus algorithms
- CRITICAL: Adaptive filters can become unstable without bounds

## Implementation Blueprint

### Filter Characteristics

**Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF)**:
- Monte Carlo approximation using ensemble of states
- Handles nonlinear dynamics without linearization
- Ensemble size typically 50-100 for million-dimensional problems
- Variants: Stochastic EnKF, Deterministic EnKF (ETKF), Local EnKF (LETKF)
- Key operations: Ensemble propagation, covariance from ensemble, Kalman gain

**Particle Filter (PF)**:
- Sequential Monte Carlo method
- Represents distribution with weighted particles
- Handles arbitrary distributions and nonlinearities
- Key operations: Particle propagation, weight update, resampling
- Variants: Bootstrap PF, Auxiliary PF, Rao-Blackwellized PF

**Cubature Kalman Filter (CKF)**:
- Uses spherical-radial cubature rule for integration
- 2n cubature points (vs 2n+1 for UKF)
- Third-degree accuracy in Gaussian integrals
- More stable than UKF for certain problems
- Square-root version for numerical stability

**Information Filter (IF)**:
- Dual of Kalman filter using information form
- State: information vector y = P^(-1)x
- Covariance: information matrix Y = P^(-1)
- Better for sparse measurements
- Natural for distributed/decentralized fusion

**Additional Variations**:
- Adaptive Kalman Filter: Online noise estimation
- Federated Kalman Filter: Distributed multi-sensor fusion
- Constrained Kalman Filter: State constraints handling
- Iterative Kalman Filter: Improved linearization

## Notes for AI Agent
- Start with EnKF as most widely used advanced filter
- Implement particle filter with systematic resampling first
- CKF can reuse much UKF infrastructure
- Information filter needs careful matrix inversion handling
- Consider memory pool for particle allocation
- Use const generics where dimension known at compile time
- Profile ensemble operations for parallelization opportunities
- Add filter selection guide in documentation
- Test with standard benchmark problems (Lorenz 96, etc.)

## Quality Score: 8/10
Comprehensive coverage of major advanced Kalman filter variations with practical implementation guidance. Includes high-dimensional, non-Gaussian, and distributed scenarios. Strong emphasis on comparative analysis and appropriate filter selection. Deducted points for complexity that may require splitting into multiple PRPs and some advanced topics (IMM, GSF) only briefly mentioned.
