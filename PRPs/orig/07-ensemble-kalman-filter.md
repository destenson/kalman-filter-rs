# PRP: Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) for High-Dimensional Data Assimilation

## Goal
Implement a scalable Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF) capable of handling high-dimensional state spaces (10,000+ dimensions) with localization and inflation techniques for data assimilation applications like weather prediction and reservoir modeling.

## Why
- **High-Dimensional Systems**: EnKF handles millions of state variables where traditional KF fails
- **Monte Carlo Approach**: Avoids explicit covariance storage and computation (O(n²) → O(n×m))
- **Nonlinear Dynamics**: Propagates ensemble through full nonlinear model without linearization
- **Industry Applications**: Core technology in weather forecasting, oil reservoir management, oceanography
- **Parallelizable**: Ensemble members can be computed independently

## What
Create an EnKF implementation that uses ensemble statistics to approximate covariance, supporting both stochastic and deterministic variants with localization and inflation for practical high-dimensional applications.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Handle state dimensions > 10,000 with ensemble size < 100
- [ ] Implement covariance localization (Gaspari-Cohn, hierarchical)
- [ ] Support multiple inflation methods (multiplicative, additive)
- [ ] Parallel ensemble propagation using Rayon
- [ ] Examples demonstrate weather/Lorenz-96 model assimilation
- [ ] Memory usage scales as O(n×m) not O(n²)
- [ ] Performance comparable to established implementations

### Known Gotchas & Library Quirks
- CRITICAL: Ensemble size must be << state dimension for efficiency
- CRITICAL: Sample covariance underestimates true covariance (needs inflation)
- CRITICAL: Spurious correlations at long distances (needs localization)
- CRITICAL: Ensemble collapse without proper spread maintenance
- CRITICAL: Perturbed observations method can add sampling noise
- CRITICAL: Square root filters avoid perturbed observations but more complex

## Implementation Blueprint

### Core EnKF Concepts

**Ensemble Representation**:
- State ensemble: X = [x₁, x₂, ..., xₘ] where m = ensemble size
- Mean: x̄ = (1/m) Σ xᵢ
- Anomalies: X' = X - x̄𝟙ᵀ
- Covariance: P ≈ (1/(m-1)) X'X'ᵀ (never formed explicitly)

**Forecast Step**:
1. Propagate each member: xᵢᶠ = M(xᵢᵃ) where M is nonlinear model
2. Compute forecast mean: x̄ᶠ = (1/m) Σ xᵢᶠ
3. Forecast anomalies: X'ᶠ = Xᶠ - x̄ᶠ𝟙ᵀ

**Analysis Step (Stochastic)**:
1. Perturb observations: yᵢ = y + εᵢ where εᵢ ~ N(0, R)
2. Compute innovations: dᵢ = yᵢ - H(xᵢᶠ)
3. Kalman gain: K = PᶠHᵀ(HPᶠHᵀ + R)⁻¹
4. Update each member: xᵢᵃ = xᵢᶠ + K dᵢ

**Analysis Step (Deterministic ETKF)**:
1. Transform matrix: T = (I + (HX'ᶠ)ᵀR⁻¹(HX'ᶠ)/(m-1))⁻¹/²
2. Update anomalies: X'ᵃ = X'ᶠT
3. Update mean: x̄ᵃ = x̄ᶠ + K(y - Hx̄ᶠ)

**Localization Methods**:
- Gaspari-Cohn: Smooth cutoff function based on distance
- Hierarchical: Adaptive localization without physical distance
- Domain decomposition: Local analysis in overlapping regions

**Inflation Methods**:
- Multiplicative: X'ᵃ = ρX'ᵃ where ρ > 1
- Additive: Add random perturbations to maintain spread
- Adaptive: Estimate inflation factor from innovation statistics

- Implement Gaspari-Cohn localization first
- Default ensemble size: 2×sqrt(n) where n = state dim
- Use column-major storage for cache efficiency
- Profile memory allocation patterns
- Consider chunking for very large states
- Add MPI support as future enhancement
- Include timing benchmarks in examples

## Quality Score: 9/10
Highly focused PRP specifically for EnKF with deep coverage of ensemble methods, localization, and inflation techniques crucial for high-dimensional applications. Includes both stochastic and deterministic variants with clear mathematical specifications. Strong emphasis on scalability and parallelization. Deducted one point as some advanced topics (hybrid DA, 4D-EnKF) are not covered.
