# PRP: Information Filter for Sparse Measurements and Distributed Sensor Networks

## Goal
Implement an Information Filter (IF) using the dual form of the Kalman filter with information matrix and vector representation, optimized for sparse measurements, distributed sensor fusion, and decentralized estimation.

## Why
- **Sparse Measurements**: Natural handling of no measurements (simple prediction)
- **Distributed Fusion**: Information form enables simple fusion via addition
- **Numerical Stability**: Better conditioning for nearly singular covariances
- **Computational Efficiency**: Sparse information matrices for sensor networks
- **Decentralized Architecture**: Local processing with global consistency

## What
Create an Information Filter framework that operates on information matrices (inverse covariance) and information vectors, supporting both centralized and decentralized architectures for multi-sensor fusion.

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Dual representation with information matrix Y = P⁻¹ and vector y = P⁻¹x
- [ ] Efficient sparse measurement updates
- [ ] Distributed fusion via information addition
- [ ] Extended Information Filter (EIF) for nonlinear systems
- [ ] Decentralized consensus algorithms
- [ ] Examples demonstrate sensor network fusion
- [ ] Performance advantages for sparse sensing

- CRITICAL: Time-varying dimensions need careful handling

## Implementation Blueprint

### Core Information Filter Mathematics

**Information Form Representation**:
- Information matrix: Y = P⁻¹
- Information vector: y = Y·x = P⁻¹·x
- State recovery: x = Y⁻¹·y (when needed)

**Information Filter Equations**:

**Prediction** (more complex than KF):
- Information matrix: Yₖ|ₖ₋₁ = (F·Yₖ₋₁⁻¹·Fᵀ + Q)⁻¹
- Information vector: yₖ|ₖ₋₁ = Yₖ|ₖ₋₁·F·Yₖ₋₁⁻¹·yₖ₋₁

**Update** (simpler than KF):
- Information matrix: Yₖ = Yₖ|ₖ₋₁ + Hᵀ·R⁻¹·H
- Information vector: yₖ = yₖ|ₖ₋₁ + Hᵀ·R⁻¹·z

**Key Properties**:
- No measurement: Simply skip update (Y and y unchanged)
- Multiple sensors: Y = Y₀ + Σᵢ Hᵢᵀ·Rᵢ⁻¹·Hᵢ
- Information addition: yₖ = y₀ + Σᵢ Hᵢᵀ·Rᵢ⁻¹·zᵢ

**Extended Information Filter (EIF)**:
For nonlinear systems:
- Linearize around current estimate
- Use Jacobians similar to EKF
- Information form handles sparse Jacobians efficiently

**Distributed Architecture**:
- Local nodes: Maintain local Yᵢ, yᵢ
- Communication: Exchange information contributions
- Consensus: Average information across neighbors
- Global consistency via graph theory

**Square-Root Information Filter (SRIF)**:
- Propagate R where Y = RᵀR
- QR decomposition for updates
- Better numerical properties
