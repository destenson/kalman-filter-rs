# PRP: Algorithm Validation and Correctness Testing

## Goal
Implement comprehensive validation tests to prove algorithmic correctness, numerical stability, and mathematical properties of all Kalman filter implementations against theoretical guarantees and reference implementations.

## Why
- **Mathematical Correctness**: Need to verify filters match theoretical equations
- **Numerical Stability**: Must handle edge cases (singular matrices, extreme values)
- **Property Testing**: Kalman filters have invariants that must hold
- **Reference Validation**: Compare against established implementations
- **Regression Prevention**: Ensure optimizations don't break correctness

## What
Create a validation test suite that:
1. Verifies mathematical properties (covariance positive semi-definite, etc.)
2. Tests against analytical solutions for known systems
3. Compares with reference implementations (MATLAB/Python)
4. Property-based testing for invariants
5. Numerical stability tests for edge cases
6. Convergence and consistency tests

### Success Criteria
- [ ] All filters pass mathematical property tests
- [ ] Match analytical solutions within numerical tolerance
- [ ] Consistent with scipy.signal.kalmanfilter results
- [ ] Property tests with 1000+ random inputs pass
- [ ] Handle singular/near-singular matrices gracefully
- [ ] Documented validation methodology

### Mathematical Properties to Validate
Based on Kalman filter theory:

1. **Covariance Properties**
   - P must remain positive semi-definite
   - P should decrease (or stay same) after measurement update
   - Symmetry: P = P^T within tolerance

2. **Optimality Properties**
   - Kalman gain minimizes posterior estimate covariance
   - Innovation sequence should be white noise
   - State estimates unbiased for linear systems

3. **Numerical Properties**
   - Joseph form update preserves positive definiteness
   - Symmetric updates preserve symmetry
   - Condition number bounds for stability

4. **Convergence Properties**
   - Steady-state for constant systems
   - Bounded error for stable systems
   - Observability/controllability requirements

### Known Validation Challenges
- Floating point comparison needs epsilon tolerance
- Different matrix decomposition methods give different results
- Numerical errors accumulate over long sequences
- Near-singular matrices need special handling
- Random test data needs careful seeding

### Test Data Sources
- Synthetic systems with analytical solutions
- Real sensor data from IMU/GPS datasets
- Standard benchmark problems (e.g., g-h filter, alpha-beta filter)
- Edge cases: zero process noise, zero measurement noise, singular matrices

## Implementation Blueprint

### Task List (in order)

1. **Create validation test utilities**
   - Matrix property checkers (symmetric, positive definite)
   - Floating point comparison with tolerance
   - Test data generators for known systems
   - Reference solution loaders (CSV/JSON)
   - Statistical test helpers (chi-squared, etc.)

2. **Implement mathematical property tests**
   - Covariance remains positive semi-definite
   - Symmetry preservation after updates
   - Innovation whiteness test
   - Gain optimality verification
   - State estimate bias test

3. **Add analytical solution tests**
   - Constant velocity model (closed form)
   - Steady-state filter (algebraic Riccati)
   - Static system (measurement only)
   - Oscillator with known trajectory
   - Random walk with known variance growth

4. **Create reference comparison tests**
   - Load scipy.signal KalmanFilter results
   - Compare with adskalman outputs
   - Validate against published examples
   - Cross-check filter variants (KF vs IF equivalence)

5. **Implement property-based tests**
   - Use quickcheck for random inputs
   - Invariant: predict-update cycle preserves dimension
   - Property: measurement reduces uncertainty
   - Consistency: multiple updates = combined update
   - Commutativity: independent measurements order

6. **Add numerical stability tests**
   - Near-singular covariance matrices
   - Extreme value inputs (very large/small)
   - Zero process/measurement noise
   - Rank-deficient measurement matrices
   - Long-running filter stability (10000+ steps)

7. **Create convergence tests**
   - Steady-state detection
   - Error bound verification
   - Consistency across time steps
   - Monte Carlo convergence rate
   - Distributed filter consensus

8. **Build validation report**
   - Generate VALIDATION.md with methodology
   - Include test coverage metrics
   - Document numerical tolerances used
   - Provide reproducible test commands
   - Add continuous validation in CI

## Validation Criteria

### Numerical Tolerances
- Floating point equality: 1e-10 relative, 1e-12 absolute
- Covariance symmetry: 1e-10 maximum element difference
- Positive definiteness: minimum eigenvalue > -1e-10
- Reference comparison: 1e-6 relative error acceptable

### Statistical Tests
- Innovation whiteness: Ljung-Box test p-value > 0.05
- Estimate bias: Mean error < 0.01 * measurement noise
- Convergence: Steady-state within 100 iterations
- Monte Carlo: 95% within theoretical bounds

## Error Handling Strategy
- Tests should clearly report which property failed
- Include matrix values in assertion messages
- Provide context (iteration number, filter state)
- Separate numerical issues from algorithmic errors
