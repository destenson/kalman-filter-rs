## Performance Benchmarks

### Performance Comparison Status

**Note: Actual benchmarks have not been run yet.** The following comparisons are based on:
- General language performance characteristics
- Reported benchmarks from individual library documentation
- Known algorithmic complexity

### Expected Performance Characteristics

| Language | Expected Performance | Memory Model | Notes |
|----------|---------------------|--------------|-------|
| C++ | Excellent | Manual/Stack | Baseline for embedded systems |
| **Rust (Ours)** | Excellent | Ownership/Stack | Should match C++ performance |
| Julia | Very Good | GC/JIT | JIT compilation provides optimization |
| Go | Good | GC | Concurrent GC may add latency |
| Java | Good | GC/JVM | JIT can optimize hot paths |
| MATLAB | Moderate | Interpreted | Vectorization helps performance |
| Python | Poor | Interpreted/GC | NumPy helps but still slowest |

### Benchmarks TODO

To properly compare performance, we need to:
1. Implement common benchmark scenarios across libraries
2. Run on same hardware with same datasets
3. Measure actual timings for predict/update cycles
4. Profile memory usage patterns
5. Test scaling behavior with dimension size

Current library includes benchmark infrastructure in `benches/kalman_benchmarks.rs` but cross-library comparison has not been performed.
