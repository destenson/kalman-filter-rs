I've created PRP-06: Logging Infrastructure (Quality: 8/10) for adding comprehensive logging support to
  the Kalman filter library.

  Key Features:

  - Uses the log crate facade (already added as dependency) for library-agnostic logging
  - Optional tracing_subscriber feature (already configured) for structured logging in examples
  - Zero performance overhead when logging is disabled

  Strategic Logging Points:

  1. Numerical Diagnostics: Matrix condition numbers, convergence metrics, near-singular warnings
  2. Filter Operations: Predict/update steps with state norms and innovations
  3. Error Context: Logging before errors are returned for better debugging
  4. Performance Monitoring: Timing expensive operations like matrix inversions

  Logging Levels:

  - TRACE: Detailed matrix operations
  - DEBUG: State changes, predict/update cycles
  - INFO: Initialization, configuration
  - WARN: Numerical instability, near-singular matrices
  - ERROR: Dimension mismatches, failures

  Implementation Approach:

  - Uses log::log_enabled!() to skip expensive formatting when disabled
  - Lazy evaluation for expensive diagnostics
  - Structured key=value format for machine parsing
  - No println! or eprintln! in library code

  The PRP includes comprehensive validation gates to ensure zero overhead when logging is disabled and
  provides clear patterns for consistent logging across all filter variants. Estimated effort is just 1
  day since the dependencies are already configured.
